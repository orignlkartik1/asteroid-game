# Asteroids Game (Pygame)

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple **Asteroids** game built using **Pygame**. The player controls a spaceship, moves around the screen, and shoots asteroids while avoiding collisions. If the spaceship collides with an asteroid, the game ends.

## 🎮 Gameplay
- Control the spaceship using **W, A, S, Z** keys.
- Shoot bullets using the **SPACE** key.
- Destroy asteroids by shooting them.
- If an asteroid collides with the player, the game is over.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Player spaceship with rotation and movement
✅ Shooting bullets
✅ Randomly spawning asteroids
✅ Asteroids split when shot
✅ Collision detection (Player vs Asteroid, Bullet vs Asteroid)
✅ Frame rate controlled at 60 FPS

## 🔥 Future Improvements
- **Add sound effects** (shooting, explosions, background music)
- **Better graphics** (use images instead of simple shapes)
- **Game restart screen** instead of immediate exit
- **More asteroid variations** (different sizes and speeds)
- **Add power-ups or enemies (UFOs shooting back at the player)**
